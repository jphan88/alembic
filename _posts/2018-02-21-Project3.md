I am rapidly approaching the half way mark at Metis. Time has flown faster than expected. Time flys when you're having fun and working ever so diligently on producing your first portfolio of data science projects.

I decided to predict the classification of H-1B visa petitions for my third project at Metis. I was capitvated to this topic because I have several friends who are working in the United States with a H-1B visa. The H-1B is a non-immigrant visa that allows US employers to temporarily employ foreign talent for specialty occupations. It is the responsibility for the employer to submit the H-1B petition.  The government sets the cap of visas to 65,000. When that cap is surpassed, the certified petitions will enter a random lottery to be selected for a H-1B  visa. Therefore I will solely be predicting whether the H-1B  petition will be certified or denied and not the actual granting of the H-1B visa.

I retrieved my dataset from Kaggle which can be seen below. It includes the case status: certified and denied. I had over 220K of unique employer names and over 1500 unique standard occupational codes. It would have taken too much computation power to convert the features as dummies so instead I transformed the features by finding the certified rate and total petitions submitted by employer name and occupational code. Further more I had to extract the state from worksite and convert it into dummies. My data set included prevailing wage, full time position, and the petitions from 2011 – 2016.

As you can see the data set is very imbalanced, I have 97% of  my data is made up of certified petitions. I will later go back and explain how I resolved this when building my models. Another thing you’ll notice as the years move forward the number of denied petitions decreases. This is a strong indicator that year will be an important feature in helping the model classify the petitions.
