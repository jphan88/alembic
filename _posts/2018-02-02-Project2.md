Onto Week 2 and 3! This week we went over web scraping data using BeautifulSoup and Selenium. It proved to be a very important tool in our next project that delt with predicting using Linear Regression. The objective of Project 2 was to build a linear regression model using data we scraped from the web and use the several techniques we learned in class.  I was a bit relieved we had two weeks to work on this project so I felt less rushed and more confident I could produce a better work product than my first project.

I quickly knew what topic I would choose. As a UFC fan I decided to predict pay per view buys. I had a couple of ideas of what factors I would be including but in order to fully explore all those features I went over to Tapology (UFC biggest network website) and FightMetric.com to see what type of data would be available.

Luckily FightMetric included a lot of information on one table. Here is what the table looks like below.

From the table I was able to include the following features: rematch, rivalry, women's fight, weight classes, fight finishes, title fights, rounds, time on the fights. From tapology.com I was able to collected the number of attendance, ticket revenue, and of course pay per view buys. I decided to create a separate feature called "Fan Favorites" where I included UFC's top 6 mega stars that have the most fan following and unique star power. This proved to be important as these fan favorites drove a lot of these pay per view numbers.

Retorts have the "cap" and the "cucurbit" made into one. The anbik is also called the ra æs (head) of the cucurbit. The liquid in the cucurbit is heated or boiled; the vapour rises into the anbik, where it cools by contact with the walls and condenses, running down the spout into the receiver. A modern descendant of the alembic is the pot still, used to produce distilled beverages.
