Onto Week 2 and 3! This week we went over web scraping data using BeautifulSoup and Selenium. It proved to be a very important tool in our next project that delt with predicting using Linear Regression. The objective of Project 2 was to build a linear regression model using data we scraped from the web and use the several techniques we learned in class.  I was a bit relieved we had two weeks to work on this project so I felt less rushed and that I could produce a better work product than my first project.

I quickly knew what topic I would choose. As a UFC fan I decided to predict pay per view buys. I had a couple of ideas of what factors I would be including but in order to fully explore all those features I went over to Tapology (UFC biggest network website) and FightMetric.com to see what type of data would be available.

Retorts have the "cap" and the "cucurbit" made into one. The anbik is also called the ra æs (head) of the cucurbit. The liquid in the cucurbit is heated or boiled; the vapour rises into the anbik, where it cools by contact with the walls and condenses, running down the spout into the receiver. A modern descendant of the alembic is the pot still, used to produce distilled beverages.
